Neuroneko: Advancing Cognitive Skills Through Play
Welcome to Neuroneko, a website designed to help improve cognitive functions through fun and engaging mini-games. Our project focuses on the NeuroTech track, aiming to assist in the treatment of brain dysfunction by targeting memory, spatial awareness, and processing speed.

Project Overview
Neuroneko offers a personalized experience to users by providing an optional cognitive test that assesses key cognitive skills. Based on the results, users are guided to specific games tailored to enhance their memory, spatial awareness, or processing speed.

For those who prefer, games can also be accessed directly without taking the cognitive test. Throughout the games, players can earn points that can be redeemed for virtual treats for their cats—adding an extra layer of fun to the experience!

Features
Cognitive Test: Assess your cognitive skills in memory, spatial awareness, and processing speed to receive personalized game recommendations.
Three Mini-Games:
Colorful Cats: Memory Meow – Test and improve your short-term memory by recalling the colors of cute cats.
Neko's Maze – Navigate through a 2D maze, testing your spatial awareness and problem-solving skills.
Catch the Laser – Sharpen your reflexes by catching lasers with a cat paw, testing your processing speed.
Point System: Earn points through gameplay and redeem them for fun cat treats in a virtual shop (time-permitting feature).
Game Breakdown
1. Colorful Cats: Memory Meow
This game is designed to test short-term memory by showing players a sequence of colorful cats. Players must remember the colors and answer correctly after a brief delay. The game gets progressively more difficult by adding more cats per level. If you get the answers right, you are greeted by a happy cat; if wrong, a sad cat will appear.

2. Neko's Maze
Navigate through a 2D maze and test your spatial awareness by finding the exit. Each level introduces new challenges, requiring you to strategize how to escape the maze within the given time limit.

3. Catch the Laser
In this game, a cat paw cursor is used to catch moving lasers. The speed and unpredictability of the lasers increase as the levels progress, pushing you to improve your reaction time and processing speed.
